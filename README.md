## What it does
Goosemood grabs the current date in your location (hopefully Waterloo) and uses *advanced goose algorithms* to estimate the mood of the geese. Are they happy? Are they ready to honk aggressively at you? Are they even here?

## What I learned
Built with HTML, CSS and Javascript, I was able to learn about the basics of web development and linking sources such as images, as well as some properties of the DOM.
